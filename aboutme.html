<h1>About me</h1>    <!-- this should be a carousel once I get pics--> 
<p>My name is Brian Suverkrubbe I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska . I love exotic animals, I own six ball pythons 2 bearded dragons and 4 cats. In 2025 I plan on being an exotics breeder and will travel around for reptile shows.My uncle introduced me too exotics as a young boy and ever since Ive had a passion for caring for reptiles . It is interesting to me seeing the differant behaviors of each animal I own ,one of my snakes if he isnt hungry will shake his head no if he doesnt want to eat. I also have a very attention seeking bearded dragon that will make a bunch of noise until I let her out of her cage too play . </p>
<p>I also enjoy anime and cosplay I go too 8 anime conventions a year.I love meeting new people and engaging in con activities with them . My favorite con is Collosal North in The Wisconsin, Dells . This con is my favorite because it is connected too a water park called the Kalahari!Other than going down huge slides with my friends there is also an amazing hot tub bar that serves slushy drinks!This year I am hosting a party room at the venue where I plan on serving drinks with some gaming themed lofi music! </p>
