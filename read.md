STart on home I made my front page with a picture of myself with a small about me text box I used css too style my pages which I thought looked cool however not something I would use for an actual for a job interview . I plan on reworking this with a little bootstrap and adding more white into the mix for a more apealing webpage.however I have 2 home keys one that says home and the other is the d20 on the left corner if you push the d20 it should spin I plan on making this go across the nav bar and make a dice noise in the future. I hav a services and an about me link you can click on that will take you too the respective pages on the about me I would like too summarize everything and make a carrousel that way I touch on key points about my personality . I have a services that I made with cards however I realized this may be a poor choice due too the lack of pics of this stuff that I have . I will need too make a linkedin soon too link to .I curanly use indeed .I made a couple of mistakes on this peoject with how it is layed out I wish I wouldve went with a more organized approach from bootstrap but when I designed it I was trying too do it all myself which took way longer .
